# üé∂ Spotify Music Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores what makes a song popular using a Spotify dataset.  
The dataset was cleaned and analyzed using both **Python (Pandas + SQLAlchemy)** and **PostgreSQL (SQL queries)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (data cleaning and visualization, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- **PostgreSQL** (data storage & querying)  
- **SQL** (data cleaning and analysis)

## üìä Data Cleaning & Preparation

### üîπ Dataset Overview
- **Total tracks (raw):** 81,201  
- **Key columns:** `track_id`, `track_name`, `artists`, `album_name`, `duration_ms`, `popularity`, `danceability`, `energy`, `valence`, `track_genre`  
- **Source:** Spotify sample dataset (CSV file provided).  

### üîπ Cleaning in SQL
1. **Removed duplicate rows**  
   - Deduplicated on (`track_name`, `artists`) combination.  
2. **Standardized text columns**  
   - Applied `TRIM()` to remove leading/trailing spaces.  
3. **Handled invalid durations**  
   - Removed tracks with `duration_ms = 0`.  
   - Removed tracks with `duration_ms > 900,000 ms` (~15 minutes).  

### üîπ SQL Scripts
All SQL queries used for data cleaning, deduplication, and summarization are stored in the `sql/` folder.  
These scripts can be run to reproduce the cleaned dataset (`tracks_cleaned`) used for analysis.


### üîπ Cleaning in Python
1. **Loaded dataset into PostgreSQL** using SQLAlchemy.  
2. **Standardized missing values**:  
   - Replaced blanks (`''`) with `NaN`.  
   - Filled missing `artists`, `album_name`, and `track_name` with `"Unknown Artist"`, `"Unknown Album"`, `"Untitled Track"`.  
3. **Trimmed whitespace** in string columns.  
4. **Replaced empty strings with `"Unknown"`** across all text fields.  
5. **Filled numeric columns** with their median values.  
6. **Saved cleaned data** back into PostgreSQL as `tracks_cleaned`.  

### üîπ Summary Statistics (after cleaning)
| Metric              | Value   |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Total tracks**     | 81,201  |
| **Avg popularity**   | 34.7    |
| **Popularity stdev** | 19.3    |
| **Avg danceability** | 0.56    |
| **Avg energy**       | 0.64    |
| **Avg valence**      | 0.46    |

- **Popularity range:** 0 ‚Äì 100 (valid, no errors found).  
- **Duration distribution:** Most songs are ~3‚Äì4 minutes, consistent with typical music.  

üëâ The final cleaned dataset is stored as a new table: **`tracks_cleaned`**.

## üîç Popularity Analysis
**Question:** What makes a song popular?  
- Compare `danceability`, `energy`, and `valence` with popularity scores.  
- Identify audio features most correlated with popularity.  

We analyzed audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, instrumentalness, and tempo to see how they relate to popularity.

Correlation analysis was performed in Python (pandas).

üîπ Correlation with Popularity

| Feature          | Correlation with Popularity | Interpretation |
|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Danceability     | 0.035                       | Slight positive effect |
| Tempo            | 0.013                       | Almost no effect |
| Energy           | 0.001                       | No meaningful relationship |
| Acousticness     | -0.025                      | Slight negative effect |
| Valence          | -0.041                      | Very weak negative effect |
| Instrumentalness | -0.095                      | Instrumental tracks tend to be less popular |

### Key Takeaways:

Instrumental content is the strongest (though still small) predictor of lower popularity.

Danceable songs have a tiny positive influence on popularity.

Overall, audio features alone explain very little of popularity; other factors like artist, marketing, or trends likely play a larger role.

### üîπ Visualizations

Scatter plots and heatmaps were generated to explore these relationships visually:

Scatter plots: Popularity vs. danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, instrumentalness, and tempo.

Heatmap: Shows all pairwise correlations between features and popularity.

### üìùFindings & Summary 

Based on our visualizations and statistical analysis, we found no strong linear relationship between any of the audio features and a song's popularity.

Scatter Plots: The scatter plots showed a random distribution of points. For every audio feature, songs with low, medium, and high popularity scores were present across the entire range of the feature's values. There was no visible upward or downward trend.

Correlation Heatmap: The heatmap confirmed the visual findings. The correlation coefficients between all audio features and popularity were very close to zero, ranging from -0.10 to 0.04. This indicates a weak to non-existent linear correlation. For example, the correlation between "danceability" and "popularity" was only 0.04, suggesting that a song's danceability score is not a reliable predictor of its popularity.
